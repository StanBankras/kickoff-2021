## Description

This is a business card I made for the minor web development & web design. In this card there's information about myself, and the team I work with during this minor.

<!-- Add a nice poster image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend ðŸ“¸ -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties ðŸŒ  -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? âœ… -->

<!-- How about a license here? ðŸ“œ (or is it a licence?) ðŸ¤· -->
